# Emailer app

This is a an application which I use as test platform for different experiments with Angular 4+, Rxjs, Node etc.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.3.

## Development server

Run `npm run start-dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Also it starts Node server with emails API.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. And `npm run buid-prod` for production build. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Deployment

The project is madually deployed to Heroku, jsru-ng2-hw1.herokuapp.com .

## Testing

Tests will be later, but not for everithing, only interestiing cases.
